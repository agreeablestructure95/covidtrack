            <p>India has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of cases and a large number of recoveries. As one of the most populous countries in the world, India's response to the pandemic has involved nationwide lockdowns, vaccination drives, and continuous monitoring of cases across its states and cities. The situation has been dynamic, with varying numbers of new cases, recoveries, and fatalities reported daily.</p>
            
            <p>The Indian government, along with state and local health authorities, has worked to manage the crisis through various health initiatives, including the vaccination campaign, which began in January 2021. The vaccination drive has made remarkable progress, with millions of doses administered, helping to reduce the severity of cases and prevent widespread outbreaks.</p>
            
            <p>As of now, each state and city in India has been managing its COVID-19 response individually while coordinating with the central government for resources and guidelines. The situation varies across different regions, with some states seeing more active cases than others. The COVID-19 Tracking and Information Dashboard provides real-time data on active cases, recoveries, and fatalities, helping authorities, health workers, and citizens stay informed and take necessary precautions.</p>
